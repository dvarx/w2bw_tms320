# W2BW TMS320 3-axis Hall effect sensor
There are different versions of the sensor A0,A1,A2,A3. The A0 version is featured in the standard breakout board from Infineon. For the endoscope version, we used the A1 version.
There are no differences between the sensors except for their different I2C addressed.

Change the sensor definition in the header file to compile code for the different sensors.
